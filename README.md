# MATRIX MULTIPLICATION

## Sub-cubic Algorithm
### 1. Strassen's Algorithm

Naive algorithm costs O($$n^3$$). Thanks to Strassen, we can reach to O($$n^(2.8)$$)

### 2. Coppersmith - Winograd algorithm

New technique and research give us better chance for completely computing multiplication as fast as have ever seen.
O($$n^(2.3)$$) is the result for years or attemping.
